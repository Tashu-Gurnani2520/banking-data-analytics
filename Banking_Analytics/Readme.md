# Data Analysis Project on Banking Dataset

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a banking dataset to derive insights into credit card spending and repayment behaviors. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib, the analysis computes metrics such as monthly spending, repayment, and profit for the bank. The dataset consists of approximately 2000 rows.

## Features

### Data Analysis: 
Utilized Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation and processing.

### Visualization: 
Created visualizations using Matplotlib to depict trends and insights.

### Metrics Computation: Computed:
